We designed and developed this game largely on our own so we are releasing the art assets and code that we worked on. All sounds and music were purchased and therfore will remain unavailable making some of the code difficult to run. We apologize for the inconvenience, but this is to respect the original creators of those materials and their right to distribution.

Any file ending in .script was written by me (paul-Hugo Dlugy-Hegwer), other endings such as .atlas, and .collection were put together by the Defold game engine.
